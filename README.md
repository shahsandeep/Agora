### Features

- **Splash screen:** and app icon included.
- **Authentication & Login Screen:** a simple email/password form with validation and mock authentication using Reqres
- **Session management and logout:** persist session token (shared_preferences), validate/refresh session on app start, and provide a logout action that clears stored session data and returns to the login screen.
- **Audio and Video Calls:** Using Agora SDK for real-time communication.
- **Audio Calls UI:** Calling UI with mic, speaker, hangup button, and timer on call receive.
- **Video Calls UI:** Calling UI with camera disable, mic mute, camera flip, and hangup button, on call receive.
- **Screen Sharing:** Screen sharing capability during video calls.

- **Device Connection Status:** Checking device connection status if it is connected to network or not.
- **Users screen:** with dummy users cached in Hive (load local first, then fetch fresh from API).
- **Github Actions:** When you push code to the main branch, GitHub automatically builds the Android app and creates a Release with the generated APK files. This means you get a downloadable build without doing any manual build steps. To allow the workflow to upload releases, add a repository secret named `TOKEN`.
